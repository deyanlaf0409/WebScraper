# S04-Python-team-5
This project is made by me and my 3 comrades throughout our coding bootcamp.
Not perfect, but it covers the main requierments which are:

                                                       - OOP Design
                                                       
                                                       - Tests cover around 75%
                                                       
                                                       - Works as expected
                                                       
# What it does?
Scrapes books info from "http://books.toscrape.com" and saves that info in readable format as json file.

You can add some arguments depending on what are you searching for (price range, title, rating etc.), or just "gonna catch 'em all!" (Which i don't recommend).

Add -X as argument for Graphical User Interface.

Look for quick instructions below.
